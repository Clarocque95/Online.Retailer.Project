## ONLINE SPORTS RETAILER SALES ANALYSIS

This is a SQL project I completed using a dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset contained 5 tables (info, brands, reviews, traffic and finance) and all tables contained a product_id column as the primary key. 

I deleted the finance table and created a transactions table instead. This made the dataset more realistic and allowed me to perform interesting time-series analysis. 

This project helped me improve my SQL skills by using subqueries, CTE's (common table expressions) and window functions. Every query was useful in gaining important insights into the sales of this online retailer.
